# Programming for AI Assignment 2

**The paper selected for this assignment was "Long-Term Coronary Artery Disease Risk Prediction with Machine Learning Models", published on 20 January 2023, in the HEC W Category ranked journal, Sensors.**

The paper is linked [here](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/3/1193).

- The v2_final.ipynb has the code implemented for the research paper. EDA has also been performed in this file.
- The pipeline.ipynb file has the code restructured in FunctionTransformer, ColumnTransformer and SKlearn Pipeline.
- The paper.pdf file is the pdf file of the research paper linked above.
- coronary_prediction.csv is the dataset used and was linked in the research paper as well. It is a publicly available dataset on Kaggle.

**Please note that the official code for the research paper was not available so I implemented the code in v2_final.ipynb according to the methodology given in the research paper.**
